                “Mena is actually my mother Myrna’s nickname. Like most IELTS test takers, she is a nurse and she used to work in Saudi Arabia. She later moved to the States during the time when it was not yet required for a foreign citizen to score high in the IELTS
                exam. Because of her work as a nurse overseas, she was able to send me and the rest of my siblings to private schools and universities. Her hard work, patience, and sacrifice have given us plenty of opportunities. I named this review center
                after her with the goal of helping nurses like her, along with other professionals, workers, and students, to achieve the IELTS score that they need so that they can study, work, or live abroad and provide a better way of life for themselves
                and their loved ones – just as my mother Mena once did.” – Johmie Aguilar, Owner and Review Center Manager.
