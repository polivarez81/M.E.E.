    </p>

    "Mena is actually my mother name Myrna's nickname." Like most IELTS test takers, she is a nurse and she used to work in Saudi Arabia. She later moved to the States during the time moved to America during the time when it was not yet required for a foreign
    citizen to score high in the IELTS exam. Because of her work as a nurse overseas, she was able to send me and the rest of my siblings to private schools and universities. Her hand work, patience, and sacfrifice have given us plenty of opportunities.
    I named this review center after her with the goal of helping nurses like her, along with other professionals, workers, and students, to achieve the IELTS score that they need so that they can study, work, or live abroad and provide a better way of
    life for themselves and their loved ones-_ just as my mother Mena once did.""
